								<h1>Songs of Conquest</h1>
							</header>

							<h1>
								Returning to the game after its full release
							</h1>
							<p>
								This spiritual successor of Heroes of Might and Magic truly is the modern take on the genre.  I played some of Songs of Conquest during its early access. I had a good time with it but it was lacking some features that were important to me. These features include controller support, Steamdeck support and online multiplayer with cross play support. Since its full release all of these features are now available.
							</p>
							<h2>
								Beautiful art design and optimization
							</h2>
							<p>
								I personally love the pixel art design of Songs of Conquest. I cant get enough of the charming characters, locations and animations. It seems this charming art style has also been leveraged to maximize performance. I have seen reports that this game can run on a toaster. So if all you have is a week ass laptop you should still have no problem playing this game. I still need to test that out for myself. I believe it though. It runs buttery smooth on the steam deck. The graphics don't seem to be very demanding for resources neither do any of the games other features. I can see how this game could run on anything. i love seeing games that are built like they are under the design constraints of the past while utilizing the power of modern technology.
							</p>
							<h2>
								Factions and play-styles
							</h2>
							<p>
								There are four distinct factions to play as. Though this may look like a very limited roster at first each faction as a variety of play-styles that make them more like three different sub factions. For instance in the Barony of Loth faction you could specialize in rats, human cultists and unleaded hoards. These sub-factions can be used together in any combination or the player could chose to focus on just one of them. So two players could both play as Barony of Loth and play it completely differently. This system offers a wide variety of play-styles and player choice.
							</p>
							<h2>
								Multiplayer
							</h2>
							<p>
								The multiplayer works well. I own a copy of SOC on GOG and my friend has a copy on Steam and I was able to send him an invite code to the lobby I was hosting and he was able to connect to problem. I had issues hosting the game because my local WIFI kept disconnecting but that is not the games fault. We had a good time and I look forward to us picking the game back up when I have a better connection to the internet. I like that tho we were playing PVP there was a lot of PVE stuff to do. I think that gives casual players an engaging experience without focusing too much on being competitive despite playing a competitive game mode. There are NPC units to fight. There are points of interest to explor to with your heroes and their armies. You build your city and concur NPC controlled ones. There is a lot to do without fighting you player opponent.
							</p>
							<h2>
								Criticism
							</h2>
							<p>
								One grievance we both had was when you are buying and selling things on the market it is easy to accidentally sell things when you mean to buy things and buy things when you mean to sell them. This wouldn't be so bad but there is a harsh exchange rate to pay if you get it wrong loosing you a lot of gold when you do. This seems like the kind of thing the player can just get used to in the long run. It is not really that big a deal.
							</p>
							<h2>
								Conclusion
							</h2>
							<p>
								If you like Heroes of Might and Magic or Civilization you should definitely give this one a try.

							<h1>
								Getting back into Subnautica
							</h1>
							<p>
								I first started playing Subnautica back when it released early access in 2014. Though the game had a long way to go I knew it had protental.
							</p>
							<p>
								Later when Subnautica reached full release I booted it up again. I played it off and on though the years but I never finished it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now it is 2024 and the game is quite mature now. It has received a healthy amount of updates over the years. Unfortunately when I booted it up this most recent time my saved game files were gone. My guess is that I last played the game so many updates ago that my old saved files lost compatibility with current builds of the game over the years. This was sad because I had a special saved file from a time I was playing the game with someone special. Despite this I am having a lot of fun with the new save I recently started.
